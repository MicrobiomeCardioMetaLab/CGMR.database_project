# CGMR.project
Chinese Gut Microbiome Resource

The gut microbiome displays significant genetic differences between populations while systematic characterization of the genomic landscape of the gut microbiome in Asia populations remains limited. Here, we present the Chinese gut microbial reference (CGMR) set, comprising 101,060 high quality metagenomic assembled genomes (MAGs) of 3,707 non-redundant species paired with 1,376 live isolates from a national wide collection of 3,234 fecal samples across China. This improved reference set contains 987 novel species compared with existing resources worldwide.
